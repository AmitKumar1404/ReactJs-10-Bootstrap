Suppose, A is component where we put (name, surname, address)

class A extends React.Component
{
	// 1. Properties
		When we use class component then we put the data in state object
	
		state={};
		
	// 2. Constructor()
		{
		  // Responsibility of constructor is to initialize your property
		
		this.state = {}

		}

	// 3. Method
}
